# setup-disk-radio

setup-disk-radio is program to turn a raspberry pi or any underused Linux/Unix 
deivce into a radio. 

Specifically, this program scrapes music-themes subreddits for new, trending 
songs, and downloads those songs to be served later in a continuous ad-free
music playback, much like a radio.
